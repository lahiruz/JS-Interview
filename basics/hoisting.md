# Welcome to hoisting

* Javascript hoisting is important concept where all **variable and function declarations** are moved to the scope that they have defined. When hoisting happens alway Function declarations gets priority over the variables. 

* If someone declare variable and function with same name that variable declaration will be ignored (refer following image).

* Variables and constants declared with let and const are not hoisted. Also Function expressions are not hoisted.
