# Javascript Basics

* Javascript is standardized as **ECMAScript(ES)** which is maintained by a committee called **TC39**. Each ES version decide what kind of features will be released to Javascript language.

* Javascript is **interpreted** and **compiled** language. ([more details can be found here](https://medium.com/@lsampath999/do-you-know-how-exactly-browser-works-9f510321ee9e))

* Currently Javascript is used as both client-side([Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), etc.) and server-side([NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)) language.

* V8 (Google Chrome, NodeJS, Electron), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), Chakra (Microsoft Edge), Javascript Core (Safari, React Native), etcâ€¦ are samples for available Browser Javascript Engines out there. (If you want clear idea about how this works check my article [here](https://medium.com/@lsampath999/do-you-know-how-exactly-browser-works-9f510321ee9e))

* Everything in Javascript is an **Object** (refer [objects](https://github.com/lahiruz/JS-Interview/blob/master/basics/objects.md) section for more details).

* Javascript also called as a multi-paradigm language. That means you can do **Functional Programming** as well as **Object Oriented Programming** with JavaScript. Javascript supports OOP with [**prototypal inheritance**](https://github.com/lahiruz/JS-Interview/blob/master/basics/prototype.md).

* Javascript is automatically garbage collected language. That means, in Javascript, it automatically allocates memory when variables/objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore.

* Javascript is a single threaded language. That means, it does one thing at a time. Now you may have a question, how it handles asynchronous operations and how it do other things that people say Javascript can do. To understand that better you need to look for [Javascript Event Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&ab_channel=JSConf).

* as a summery we can see **Javascript is interpreted or compiled, multi-paradigm, garbage collected and single threaded language which is used in both client and server side programming**.

## variables & data types

* You can create variables using **var**, **let** and **const**.

* Javascript have **Number**, **String**, **Boolean**, **Null**, **Undefined**, **Symbol**(introduced in ES6) & **Object** data types. First 6 are primitive data types. You can use **typeof** to see the actual type of the variable. Remember Array is also a special type of an object.
